<h1 class="top">Quotations</h1>

<p>Quotations are a syntax extension in Camlp5 to build
  expressions and patterns in any syntax independant from the one of
  OCaml. Quotations are <em>expanded</em>, i.e. transformed, at parse
  time to produce normal syntax trees, like the rest of the program.
  Quotations <em>expanders</em> are normal OCaml functions writable by
  any programmer.</p>

<p>The aim of quotations is to use concrete syntax for manipulating
  abstract values.  That makes programs easier to write, read, modify,
  and understand. The drawback is that quotations are linguistically isolated from the
  rest of the program, in opposition to <a href="syntext.html">syntax
  extensions</a>, which are included in the language.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A quotation is syntactically enclosed by specific quotes formed by
  less (<tt>&lt;</tt>) and greater (<tt>&gt;</tt>) signs. Namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>starting with either "<tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>" or "<tt>&lt;:ident&lt;</tt>"
    where "<tt>ident</tt>" is the quotation name,</li>
  <li>ending with "<tt>>></tt>"</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;&lt; \x.x x >>
  &lt;:foo&lt; hello, world >>
  &lt;:bar&lt; @#$%;* >>
</pre>

<p>The text between these particular parentheses can be any text. It
  may contain enclosing quotations and the characters "<tt>&lt;</tt>",
  "<tt>&gt;</tt>" and "<tt>\</tt>" can be escaped by
  "<tt>\</tt>". Notice that possible double-quote, parentheses, OCaml
  comments do not necessarily have to balanced inside them.</p>

<p>As far as the lexer is concerned, a quotation is just a kind of
  string.</p>

<h2>Quotation expander</h2>

<p>Quotations are treated at parse time. Each quotation name is
  associated with a <em>quotation expander</em>, a function
  transforming the content of the quotation into a syntax tree. There
  are actually two expanding functions, depending on whether the
  quotation is in the context of an expression or if it is in the
  context of a pattern.</p>

<p>If a quotation has no associated quotation expander, a parsing
  error is displayed and the compilation fails.</p>

<p>The quotation expander, or, rather, expanders, are functions taking
  the quotation string as parameter and returning a syntax tree. There
  is no constraint about which parsing technology is used. It can be
  <a href="parsers.html">stream
  parsers</a>, <a href="grammars.html">extensible grammars</a>, string
  scanning, ocamllex and yacc, any.</p>

<p>To build syntax trees, Camlp5 provides a way to easily build them
  see the <a href="ml_ast.html">chapter</a> about them: it is possible
  to build abstract syntax through concrete syntax using,
  precisely... quotations.</p>

<h2>Defining a quotation</h2>

<h3>By syntax tree</h3>

<p>To define a quotation, it is necessary to program the quotation
  expanders and to, finally, end the source code with a call to:</p>

<pre>
  Quotation.add name (Quotation.ExAst (f_expr, f_patt));
</pre>

<p>where "<tt>name</tt>" is the name of the quotation, and
  "<tt>f_expr</tt>" and "<tt>f_patt</tt>" the respective quotations
  expanders for expressions and patterns.</p>

<p>After compilation of the source file (without linking, i.e.
  using option "-c" of the OCaml compiler), an object file is created
  (ending with ".cmo"), which can be used as syntax
  extension <em>kit</em> of Camlp5.</p>

<h3>By string</h3>

<p>There is another way to program the expander: a single
  function which returns, not a syntax tree, but a string which is
  parsed, afterwards, by the system. This function takes a boolean as
  first parameter telling whether the quotation is in position of
  expression (True) or in position of a pattern (False).</p>

<p>Used that way, the source file must end with:</p>

<pre>
  Quotation.add name (Quotation.ExStr f);
</pre>

<p>where "<tt>f</tt>" is that quotation expander. The advantage of
  this second approach is that it is simple to understand and use.
  The drawback is that there is no way to specify different source
  locations for different parts of the quotation (what may be
  important in semantic error messages).</p>

<h3>Default quotation</h3>

<p>It is possible to use some quotation without its name. Use for that
  the variable "<tt>Quotation.default_quotation</tt>". For example,
  ending a file by:</p>

<pre>
  Quotation.add "foo" (Quotation.ExAst (f_expr, f_patt));
  Quotation.default.val := "foo";
</pre>

<p>allows to use the quotation "foo" without its name, i.e.:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;&lt; ... >>
</pre>

<p>instead of:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;:foo&lt; ... >>
</pre>

<p>If several files set the variable "<tt>Quotation.default</tt>", the
  default quotation applies to the last loaded one.</p>

<h2>Antiquotations</h2>

<p>A quotation obeys its own rules of lexing and parsing. Its result is
  a syntax tree, of type "<tt>Pcaml.expr</tt>" if the quotation is in the
  context of an expression, or "<tt>Pcaml.patt</tt>" if the quotation is
  in the context of a pattern.</p>

<p>It can be interesting to insert portions of expressions or
  patterns of the enclosing context in its own quotations. For that,
  the syntax of the quotation must define a syntax
  for <em>antiquotations areas</em>. It can be, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A character introducing a variable: in this case the antiquotation
    can just be a variable.</li>
  <li>A couple of characters enclosing the antiquotations. For
    example, in the predefined <a href="ml_ast.html">syntax tree
    quotations</a>, the antiquotations are enclosed with dollar
    ("<tt>$</tt>") signs.</li>
</ul>

<p>In quotations, the locations in the resulting syntax tree are all
  set to the location of the quotation itself (if this resulting tree
  contains locations, they are overwritten with this
  location). Consequently, if there are semantic (typing) errors, the
  OCaml compiler will underline the entire quotation.</p>

<p>But in antiquotations, since they can be inserted in the resulting
  syntax tree, it is interesting to keep their initial quotations. For
  that, the nodes:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;:expr&lt; $anti:...$ >>
  &lt;:patt&lt; $anti:...$ >>
</pre>

<p>equivalent to:</p>

<pre>
  MLast.ExAnt loc ...
  MLast.PaAnt loc ...
</pre>

<p>are provided (see <a href="ml_ast.html">syntax tree
    quotations</a>).</p>

<p>Let us take an example, without this node, and with this specific
  node.</p>

<p>Let us consider an elementary quotation system whose contents is just
  an antiquotation. This is just a school example, since the quotations
  brackets are not necessary, in this case. But we are going to see how
  the source code is underlined in errors messages.</p>

<h3>Example without antiquotation node</h3>

<p>The code for this quotation is (file "qa.ml"):</p>

<pre>
  #load "q_MLast.cmo";
  let expr s = Grammar.Entry.parse Pcaml.expr (Stream.of_string s) in
  Quotation.add "a" (Quotation.ExAst (expr, fun []));
</pre>

<p>The quotation expander "<tt>expr</tt>" just takes the string
  parameter (the contents of the quotation), and returns the result
  of the expression   parser of the OCaml language.</p>

<p>Compilation:</p>

<pre>
  ocamlc -pp camlp5r -I +camlp5 -c qa.ml
</pre>

<p>Let us test it in the toplevel with a voluntary typing error:</p>

<pre>
  $ ocaml -I +camlp5 camlp5r.cma
          Objective Caml version ...

          Camlp5 Parsing version ...

  # #load "qa.cmo";
  # let x = "abc" and y = 25 in &lt;:a&lt; x ^ y >>;
  Characters 28-41:
    let x = "abc" and y = 25 in &lt;:a&lt; x ^ y >>;
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  This expression has type int but is here used with type string
</pre>

<p>We observe that the full quotation is underlined, although it concerns
  only the variable "<tt>y</tt>".</p>

<h3>Example with antiquotation node</h3>

<p>Let us consider this second version (file "qb.ml"):</p>

<pre>
  #load "q_MLast.cmo";
  let expr s =
    let ast = Grammar.Entry.parse Pcaml.expr (Stream.of_string s) in
    let loc = Ploc.make 1 0 (0, String.length s) in
    &lt;:expr&lt; $anti:ast$ >>
  in
  Quotation.add "b" (Quotation.ExAst (expr, fun []));
</pre>

<p>As above, the quotation expander "<tt>expr</tt>" takes the string
  parameter (the contents of the quotation) and applies the expression
  parser of the OCaml language. Its result, instead of being
  returned as it is, is enclosed with the antiquotation node. (The
  location built is the location of the whole string.)</p>

<p>Compilation:</p>

<pre>
  ocamlc -pp camlp5r -I +camlp5 -c qb.ml
</pre>

<p>Now the same test gives:</p>

<pre>
  $ ocaml -I +camlp5 camlp5r.cma
          Objective Caml version ...

          Camlp5 Parsing version ...

  # #load "qb.cmo";
  # let x = "abc" and y = 25 in &lt;:b&lt; x ^ y >>;
  Characters 37-38:
    let x = "abc" and y = 25 in &lt;:b&lt; x ^ y >>;
                                         ^
  This expression has type int but is here used with type string
</pre>

<p>Notice that, now, only the variable "<tt>y</tt>" is underlined.</p>

<h3>In conclusion</h3>

<p>In the resulting tree of the quotation expander:</p>

<ul>
  <li>only portions of this tree, which are sons of the expr and patt
    antiquotation nodes, have the right location they have in the
    quotation (provided the quotation expander gives it the right
    location of the antiquation in the quotation),</li>
  <li>the other nodes inherit, as location, the location of the full
    quotation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Locations in quotations and antiquotations</h2>

<p>This section explains in details the problem of locations in
  quotations and antiquotations. It is designed for programmers of
  quotation expanders.</p>

<p>Locations are the difficult point in quotations and antiquotations.
  If they are not set correctly, error messages may highlight wrong parts
  of the source.</p>

<p>The locations are controlled:</p>

<ul>
  <li>for syntax errors: by the exception "<tt>Ploc.Exc</tt>", raised
    by the function "<tt>Ploc.raise</tt>",</li>
  <li>for typing errors, by the syntax tree nodes
    "<tt>&lt;:expr&lt;&nbsp;$anti:...$&nbsp;>></tt>" and
    "<tt>&lt;:meta&lt;&nbsp;$anti:...$&nbsp;>></tt>".</li>
</ul>

<p>If the quotation expander never uses them, all syntax and typing errors
  highlight the whole quotation.</p>

<p>Remark that in <a href="grammars.html">extensible grammars</a>,
  syntax errors are automatically enclosed by the exception
  "<tt>Ploc.Exc</tt>". Therefore, if the quotation is parsed by an
  extensible grammar entry, this exception can be raised.</p>

<p>In the syntax tree nodes
  "<tt>&lt;:expr&lt;&nbsp;$anti:...$&nbsp;>></tt>" and
  "<tt>&lt;:meta&lt;&nbsp;$anti:...$&nbsp;>></tt>", the location is
  indicated by the implicit variable named "<tt>loc</tt>". Their usage
  is therefore something like:</p>

<pre>
  let loc = ...computation of the location... in
  &lt;:expr&lt; $anti:...$ >>
</pre>

<h3>In the quotation</h3>

<p>All locations must be computed <em>relatively to the quotation
  string</em>. The quotation string is the string between
  "<tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>" or "<tt>&lt;:name&lt;</tt>" and "<tt>>></tt>"
  (excluded), the first character of this string being at location
  zero.</p>

<p>The quotation system automatically shifts all locations with the
  location of the quotation: the programmer of the quotation expander
  does not therefore need to care about where the quotation appears
  in the source.</p>

<h3>In antiquotations</h3>

<p>In antiquotations, it is important to control how the antiquotation
  string is parsed. For example, if the function parsing the antiquotation
  string raises "<tt>Ploc.Exc</tt>", the location of this exception must
  be shifted with the location of the antiquotation in the quotation.</p>

<p>For example, let us suppose that the source contains:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;&lt; abc^ijk^(xyz) >>
</pre>

<p>where the antiquotation is specified between the caret ("<tt>^</tt>")
  characters. The antiquotation string is "<tt>ijk</tt>". It can be built
  in the quotation expander by:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;:expr&lt; ijk >>
</pre>

<p>If used just like this, without the "<tt>&lt;:expr&lt; $anti:x$ >></tt>",
  in case of typing error (for example if the variable "<tt>ijk</tt>" is
  unbound), the OCaml error message will be:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;&lt; abc^ijk^(xyz) >>
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Unbound value ijk
</pre>

<p>To put a location to "<tt>ijk</tt>", since its location in the quotation
  is "<tt>(5, 8)</tt>" (the "<tt>i</tt>" being the 5th characater of the
  quotation string, starting at zero), the quotation expander can build
  it like this:</p>

<pre>
  let e = &lt;:expr&lt; ijk >> in
  let loc = Ploc.make_unlined (5, 8) in
  &lt;:expr&lt; $anti:e$ >>
</pre>

<p>In this case, the possible typing error message will be:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;&lt; abc^ijk^(xyz) >>
         ^^^
  Unbound value ijk
</pre>

<p>This case is simple, since the antiquotation is just an identifier,
  and there is no parser computing it.</p>

<p>If the antiquotation has to be parsed, for example if it is a
  complicated expression, there are two points to care about:</p>

<p>First, the syntax error messages. If the parser of the
  antiquotation raises "<tt>Ploc.Exc</tt>", its location is relative
  to the antiquotation.  It must therefore be shifted to correspond to
  a location in the quotation.  If "<tt>f</tt>" is the parsing
  function and "<tt>sh</tt>" the shift of the <em>antiquotation</em>
  in the <em>quotation</em> (whose value is "<tt>5</tt>" in the
  example), the code must be something like:</p>

<pre>
  try f () with
  [ Ploc.Exc loc exc -> Ploc.raise (Ploc.shift sh loc) exc ]
</pre>

<p>Second, the typing error messages. Here, the above code with
  "<tt>&lt;:expr&lt;&nbsp;$anti:e$&nbsp;>></tt>" can apply to the
  resulting tree.</p>

<p>The complete code, taking the possible syntax error messages and
  the possible typing error messages into account, can be (where
  "<tt>len</tt>" is the antiquotation length):</p>

<pre>
  let e =
    try f () with
    [ Ploc.Exc loc exc -> Ploc.raise (Ploc.shift sh loc) exc ]
  in
  let loc = Ploc.make_unlined (sh, sh + len) in
  &lt;:expr&lt; $anti:e$ >>
</pre>

<h2>Located errors</h2>

<p>If the quotation expander raises an exception, by default, the
  whole quotation is underlined:</p>

<pre>
  $ cat foo.ml
  #load "q_MLast.cmo";
  let expr s = raise (Failure "hello") in
  Quotation.add "a" (Quotation.ExAst (expr, fun []));

  $ ocaml -I +camlp5 camlp5r.cma
          Objective Caml version ...

          Camlp5 Parsing version ...

  # #use "foo.ml";
  - : unit = ()
  # <:a< good morning >>;
  Toplevel input:
  # <:a< good morning >>;
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  While expanding quotation "a":
  Failure: hello
</pre>

<p>To specify a location of the exception, use the function
  "<tt>Ploc.raise</tt>" instead of "<tt>raise</tt>". In this
  example, let us suppose that we want only the characters
  5 to 7 are underlined. This can be done like this:</p>

<pre>
  $ cat foo.ml
  #load "q_MLast.cmo";
  let expr s = Ploc.raise (Ploc.make 1 0 (5, 7)) (Failure "hello") in
  Quotation.add "a" (Quotation.ExAst (expr, fun []));

  $ ledit ocaml -I +camlp5 camlp5r.cma
          Objective Caml version ...

          Camlp5 Parsing version ...

  # #use "foo.ml";
  - : unit = ()
  # <:a< good morning >>;
  Toplevel input:
  # <:a< good morning >>;
             ^^
  While expanding quotation "a":
  Failure: hello
</pre>

<h2>The Quotation module</h2>

<pre style="border:0; margin-left: 1cm">
type expander =
  [ ExStr of bool -> string -> string
  | ExAst of (string -> MLast.expr * string -> MLast.patt) ]
;
</pre>

<dl><dd>
    Is the type for quotation expander kinds:
    <ul>
      <li>"<tt>Quotation.ExStr exp</tt>" corresponds to an expander
        "<tt>exp</tt>" returning a string which is parsed by the
        system to create a syntax tree. Its boolean parameter tells
        whether the quotation is in position of an expression (True)
        or in position of a pattern (False). Quotations expanders
        created this way may work for some particular OCaml syntax,
        and not for another one (e.g. may work when used with revised
        syntax and not when used with normal syntax, and
        conversely).</li>
      <li>"<tt>Quotation.ExAst (expr_exp, patt_exp)</tt>" corresponds
        to expanders returning syntax trees, therefore not necessitating
        to be parsed afterwards.  The function "<tt>expr_exp</tt>" is
        called when the quotation is in position of an expression, and
        "<tt>patt_exp</tt>" when the quotation is in position of a
        pattern. Quotation expanders created this way are independent
        from the enclosing syntax.</li>
    </ul>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>value add : string -> expander -> unit;</tt></dt>
  <dd>"<tt>Quotation.add name exp</tt>" adds the quotation "<tt>name</tt>"

</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>value find : string -> expander;</tt></dt>
  <dd>"<tt>Quotation.find name</tt>" returns the quotation expander of
    the given name.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>value default : ref string;</tt></dt>
  <dd>The name of the default quotation : it is possible to use this
    quotation between "<tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>" and "<tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>"
    without having to specify its name.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>value translate : ref (string -> string);</tt></dt>
  <dd>Function translating quotation names; default = identity. Used
    in the predefined quotation "<tt>q_phony.cmo</tt>". See below.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Some other useful functions for quotations are defined in the
  module "<tt>Pcaml</tt>". See the chapter "<a href="pcaml.html">The
  Pcaml module</a>", section "Quotation management".</p>

<h2>Predefined quotations</h2>

<h3>q_MLast.cmo</h3>

<p>This extension kit add quotations of OCaml syntax tree, allowing to
  use concrete syntax to represent abstract syntax. See the chapter
  <a href="ml_ast.html">Syntax tree</a>.</p>

<h3>q_ast.cmo</h3>

<p>As with the previous quotation, this extension kit add quotations of
  OCaml syntax tree, but in the current user syntax with all
  extensions, the previous one being restricted to revised syntax
  without extension. See the chapters
  <a href="ml_ast.html">Syntax tree</a>
  and <a href="q_ast.html">Syntax tree quotations in user
  syntax</a>.</p>

<h3>q_phony.cmo</h3>

<p>This extension kit is designed for pretty printing and must be loaded
  after a language pretty printing kit (in normal or in revised syntax).
  It prevents the expansions of quotations, transforming them
  into variables. The pretty printing then keeps the initial (source) form.</p>

<p>The <a href="macros.html">macros</a> (extension
  "<tt>pa_macro.cmo</tt>") are also displayed in their initial form,
  instead of expanded.</p>

<h2>A full example: lambda terms</h2>

<p>This example allows to represent lambda terms by a concrete syntax
  and to be able to combine them using antiquotations.</p>

<p>A lambda term is defined like this:</p>

<pre>
  type term =
    [ Lam of string and term
    | App of term and term
    | Var of string ]
  ;
</pre>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre>
  value fst = Lam "x" (Lam "y" (Var "x"));
  value snd = Lam "x" (Lam "y" (Var "y"));
  value delta = Lam "x" (App (Var "x") (Var "x"));
  value omega = App delta delta;
  value comb_s =
    Lam "x"
      (Lamb "y"
         (Lamb "z"
            (App (App (Var "x") (Var "y")) (App (Var "x") (Var "z")))));
</pre>

<p>Since combinations of lambda term may be complicated, The idea is to
  represent them by quotations in concrete syntax. We want to be able to
  write the examples above like this:</p>

<pre>
  value fst = &lt;&lt; \x.\y.x >>;
  value snd = &lt;&lt; \x.\y.y >>;
  value delta = &lt;&lt; \x.x x >>
  value omega = &lt;&lt; ^delta ^delta >>;
  value comb_s = &lt;&lt; \x.\y.\z.(x y)(x z) >>;
</pre>

<p>which is a classic representation of lambda terms.</p>

<p>Notice, in the definition of "<tt>omega</tt>", the use of the
  caret ("<tt>^</tt>") sign to specify antiquotations. Notice also the
  simplicity of the representation of the expression defining
  "<tt>comb_s</tt>".</p>

<p>Here is the code of the quotation expander, term.ml. The expander
  uses the <a href="grammars.html">extensible grammars</a>. It has its
  own lexer (using the <a href="lexers.html">stream lexers</a>)
  because the lexer of OCaml programs ("<tt>Plexer.gmake ()</tt>"),
  cannot recognize the backslashes alone.</p>
