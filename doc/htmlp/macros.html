<h1 class="top">Macros</h1>

<p>Camlp5 provides a system of macros, added by the parsing kit
  "<tt>pa_macro.cmo</tt>". Macros are values evaluated at parsing
  time.</p>

<p>When loaded, the parsing kit extends the syntax of the language and
  adds command options.</p>

<h2>Added syntax</h2>

<p>The parsing kit "<tt>pa_macro.cmo</tt>" extends the structure items
  (= toplevel phrases), the expressions and the patterns by the
  following grammar rules:</p>

                      | "IFNDEF" dexpr "THEN" cons-decl "END"
                      | "IFNDEF" dexpr "THEN" cons-decl
                        "ELSE" cons-decl "END"
 macro-rec-lab-decl ::= "IFDEF" dexpr "THEN" rec-lab-decl "END"

  macro-match-assoc ::= "IFDEF" dexpr "THEN" match_assoc "END"
                      | "IFDEF" dexpr "THEN" match-assoc
                        "ELSE" match-assoc "END"
                      | "IFNDEF" dexpr "THEN" match-assoc "END"

                        "ELSE" match-assoc "END"
          st-or-mac ::= str_macro-def
                      | structure
          sg-or-mac ::= sig-macro-def
                      | signature
             params ::= ident params
                      | ident
              dexpr ::= dexpr "OR" dexpr
                      | dexpr "AND" dexpr
                      | "NOT" dexpr

         ident-char ::= ('a'-'a' | 'A'-'Z' | '0'-'9' | '_' | ''' |
                         misc-byte)
          misc-byte ::= '\128'-'\255'
</pre>

<p>When a macro has been defined, as name e.g. "NAME", the expressions
  and patterns are extended this way:</p>

<pre>
        expr ::= "NAME"
               | "NAME" "(" expr-params ")"
        patt ::= "NAME"
               | "NAME" "(" patt-params ")"
  expr-params := expr "," expr-params
               | expr
  patt-params := patt "," patt-params
               | patt
</pre>

<p>Notice that the identifiers "<tt>DEFINE</tt>", "<tt>UNDEF</tt>",
  "<tt>IFDEF</tt>", "<tt>IFNDEF</tt>", "<tt>ELSE</tt>",
  "<tt>END</tt>", "<tt>OR</tt>", "<tt>AND</tt>" and "<tt>NOT</tt>" are
  new keywords (they cannot be used as identifiers of constructors or
  modules.</p>

<p>However, the identifiers "<tt>__FILE__</tt>" and
  "<tt>__LOCATION__</tt>" and the new defined macro names are not new
  identifiers.</p>

<h2>Added command options</h2>

<p>The parsing kit "<tt>pa_macro.cmo</tt>" also add two options usable
  in all Camlp5 commands:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><tt>-D uident</tt></dt>
  <dd>Define the uident in question like would have been a DEFINE
    (without parameter) in the code.</dd>
  <dt><tt>-U uident</tt></dt>
  <dd>Undefine the uident in question like would have been a UNDEF in
    the code.</dd>
  <dt><tt>-defined</tt></dt>
  <dd>Print the defined macros and exit.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Semantics</h2>

<p>The statement "<tt>DEFINE</tt>" defines a new macro with optional
  parameters and an optional value. The macro name must start with an
  uppercase letter.</p>

<p>The test of a macro can be done either:
  <ul>
    <li>in structure items</li>
    <li>in signature items</li>
    <li>in expressions</li>
    <li>in patterns</li>
    <li>in a constructor declaration</li>
    <li>in a match case</li>
  </ul>
  <p>using the statement "<tt>IFDEF</tt>". Its non-existence can be
    tested by "<tt>IFNDEF</tt>".  In expressions and patterns, the
    "<tt>ELSE</tt>" part is required, not in structure items.</p>

<p>The expression behind the "<tt>IFDEF</tt>" or the "<tt>IFNDEF</tt>"
  statement may use the operators "<tt>OR</tt>", "<tt>AND</tt>" and
  "<tt>NOT</tt>" and contain parentheses.</p>

<p>Notice that in an "<tt>IFDEF</tt>" where the value is True
  (resp. False), the "<tt>ELSE</tt>" (resp "<tt>THEN</tt>") part does
  not need to be semantically correct (well typed), since it does not
  appear in the resulting syntax tree. Same for "<tt>IFNDEF</tt>" and
  for possible macros parameters which are not used in the
  associated expression.</p>

<p>If a macro is defined twice, its first version is lost.</p>

<p>The statement "<tt>UNDEF</tt>" removes a macro definition.</p>

<p>When associated with a value, the "<tt>DEFINE</tt>" macro acts like
  a variable (or like a function call if it has parameters), except that
  the parameters are evaluated at parse time and can also be used also
  in pattern positions. Notice that this is a way to define constants
  by name in patterns. For example:</p>

<pre>
  DEFINE WW1 = 1914;
  DEFINE WW2 = 1939;
  value war_or_year =
    fun
    [ WW1 -> "world war I"
    | WW2 -> "world war II"
    | _ -> "not a war" ]
  ;
</pre>

<p>In the definition of a macro, if the expression contains an
  evaluation, the evaluation is not done by Camlp5 but just
  transmitted as code. In this case, it does not work in pattern
  position. Example in the toplevel:</p>

<pre>
  # DEFINE PLUS(x, y) = x + y;
  # PLUS(3, 4);
  - : int = 7
  #   fun [ PLUS(3, 4) -> () ];
  Toplevel input:
  #   fun [ PLUS(3, 4) -> () ];
            ^^^^^^^^^^
  Failure: this is not a constructor, it cannot be applied in a pattern
</pre>

<p>On the other hand, if the expression does not contain evaluation,
  this is possible:</p>

<pre>
  # DEFINE FOO(x, y) = (x, Some y);
  # FOO(True, "bar");
  - : (bool * option string) = (True, Some "bar")
  # fun [ FOO(_, "hello") -> 0 | _ -> 1 ];
  - : ('a * option string) -> int = &lt;fun>
</pre>

<p>The macro "<tt>__FILE__</tt>" is replaced by the current compiled source
  file name. In the OCaml toplevel, its value is the empty string.</p>

<p>The macro "<tt>__LOCATION__</tt>" is replaced by the the current location
  (two integers in number of characters from the beginning of the file,
  starting at zero) of the macro itself.</p>

<p>In signatures, the macro definitions can return types which can be
  used in type definitions.</p>

<p>In constructor declarations and in match cases, it is possible to
  conditionally define some cases by "<tt>IFDEF</tt>" or
  "<tt>IFNDEF</tt>". For example:</p>

<pre>
  type t =
    [ A of int
    | IFNDEF FOO THEN
        B of string
      END
    | C of bool ]
  ;

  match x with
  [ A i -> j
  | IFNDEF FOO THEN
      B s -> toto
    END
  | C b -> e ];
</pre>

<h2>Predefined macros</h2>

<p>The macro "<tt>CAMLP5</tt>" is always predefined.</p>

<p>The macro "<tt>OCAML_oversion</tt>" is predefined, where
  "<tt>oversion</tt>" is the OCaml version the Camlp5 program has been
  compiled with, where all characters but numbers are replaced by
  underscores. For example, if using OCaml 3.09.3, the macro
  "<tt>OCAML_3_09_3</tt>" is defined.</p>

<p>Moreover, for <em>some</em> Camlp5 versions (and all the versions
  which follows them), the macro "<tt>CAMLP5_version</tt>" is defined
  where "<tt>version</tt>" is the Camlp5 version where all characters
  but numbers are replaced by underscores. For example, in version
  4.02, the macro "<tt>CAMLP5_4_02</tt>" had been defined and this
  macro have appeared in all versions of Camlp5 since 4.02.</p>

<p>To see which macros are predefined, type:</p>
