<h1 class="top">Functional parsers</h1>

<p>Purely functional parsers are an alternative
  of <a href="parsers.html">stream parsers</a> where the used stream
  type is a lazy non-destructive type. These streams are lazy values,
  as in classical stream parsers, but the values are not removed as
  long as the parsing advances.</p>

<p>To make them work, the parsers of purely functional streams return,
  not the simple values, but a value of type option :
  "<code>None</code>" meaning "no match" (the equivalent of the
  exception "<code>Parse.Failure</code>" of normal streams) and
  "<code>Some (r, s)</code>" meaning "the result is r and the
  remaining stream is s".</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The syntax of purely functional parsers, when loading
  "pa_fstream.cmo", is the following:</p>

<pre>
          expression ::= fparser
                       | match-with-fparser
             fparser ::= "fparser" pos-opt "[" parser-cases "]"
                       | "fparser" pos-opt parser-case
  match-with-fparser ::= "match" expression "with" fparser
        parser-cases ::= parser-cases parser-case
                       | &lt;nothing&gt;
         parser-case ::= "[:" stream-pattern ":]" pos-opt "->" expression
                       | "[:" ":]" pos-opt "->" expression
      stream-pattern ::= stream-patt-comp
                       | stream-patt-comp ";" stream-pattern
    stream-patt-comp ::= "`" pattern
                       | "`" pattern "when" expression
                       | pattern "=" expression
                       | pattern
                       | "when" expression
             pos-opt ::= pattern
                       | &lt;nothing&gt;
</pre>

<p>Notice that, unlike classical parsers, there is no difference, in a
  stream pattern, between the first stream pattern component and the
  other ones. In particular, there is no "question mark" syntax and
  expression optionnally ending those components. Moreover, the
  "lookahead" case is not necessary, we see further why. The syntaxes
  "pattern when" and "let..in" inside stream patterns we see in
  classical parsers are not implemented. </p>

<h2>Streams</h2>

<p>The functional parsers are functions taking as parameters
  functional streams, which are values of type "<code>Fstream.t
  a</code>" for some type "<code>a</code>". It is possible to build
  functional streams using the functions defined in the module
  "<code>Fstream</code>":</p>

<h3>Fstream.from</h3>

<p>"<code>Fstream.from f</code>" returns a stream built from the
function "<code>f</code>". To create a new stream element, the
function "<code>f</code>" is called with the current stream count,
starting with zero. The user function "<code>f</code>" must return
either "<code>Some &lt;value&gt;</code>" for a value or
"<code>None</code>" to specify the end of the stream.</p>

<h3>Fstream.of_list</h3>

<p>Return a stream built from the list in the same order.</p>

<h3>Fstream.of_string</h3>

<p>Return a stream of the characters of the string parameter.</p>

<h3>Fstream.of_channel</h3>

<p>Return a stream of the characters read from the input channel
parameter.</p>

<h2>Semantics of parsers</h2>

<h3>Fparser</h3>

<p>The purely functional parsers act like classical parsers, with a
recursive descent algorithm, except that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the first stream pattern component matches the beginning of
    the stream, there is no error if the following stream patterns
    components do not match: the control simply passes to the next
    parser case with the initial stream.</li>
  <li>If the semantic actions are of type "<code>t</code>", the result
    of the parser is of type "<code>option (t * Fstream.t)</code>",
    not just "<code>t</code>" like in classical parsers. If a stream
    pattern matches, the semantic action is evaluated, giving some
    result "<code>e</code>" and the result of the parser is
    "<code>Some (e, strm)</code>" where "<code>strm</code>" is the
    remaining stream.</li>
  <li>If no parser case matches, the result of the parser is
    "<code>None</code>".</li>
</ul>

<h3>Error position</h3>

<p>A difficulty, with purely functional parsers, is how to find the
  position of the syntax error, when the input is wrong. Since the
  system tries all parsers cases before returning "<code>None</code>",
  and that the initial stream is not affected, it is not possible to
  directly find where the error happened. This is a problem for
  parsing using backtracking (here, it is limited backtracking, but
  the problem is the same).</p>

<p>The solution is to use the function
  "<tt>Fstream.count_unfrozen</tt>" applied to the initial
  stream. Like its name says, it returns the number of unfrozen
  elements of the stream, which is exactly the longest match found. If
  the input is a stream of characters, the return of this function is
  exactly the position in number of characters from the beginning of
  the stream.</p>

<p>However, it is not possible to know directly which rule failed and
  therefore it is not possible, as in classical parsers, to specify
  and get clear error messages. Future versions of purely functional
  parsers may propose solutions to resolve this problem.</p>

<p>Notice that, if using the "<tt>count_unfrozen</tt>" method, it is
  not possible to reuse that same stream to call another parser, and
  hope to get the right position of the error, if another error
  happens, since it may test less terminals than the first parser. Use
  a fresh stream in this case, if possible.</p>
