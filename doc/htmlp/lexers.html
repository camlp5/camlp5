<h1 class="top">Stream lexers</h1>

<p>The file "<tt>pa_lexer.cmo</tt>" is a Camlp5 syntax extension kit
  for parsers of streams of the type 'char'. This syntax is shorter
  and more readable than its equivalent version written
  with <a href="parsers.html">classical stream parsers</a>. Like
  classical parsers, they use recursive descendant parsing. They are
  also pure syntax sugar, and each lexer written with this syntax can
  be written using normal parsers syntax.</p>

<div id="tableofcontents">
</div>

<p>(An old version, named "<tt>pa_lex.cmo</tt>" was provided before
  with a different syntax. It is no longer distributed, its proposed
  syntax being confusing.)</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Classical parsers in OCaml apply to streams of any type of
  values. For the specific type "char", it has been possible to
  shorten the encoding in several ways, in particular by using strings
  to group several characters together, and by hidding the management
  of a "lexing buffer", a data structure recording the matched
  characters.</p>

<p>Let us take an example. The following function parses a left
  bracket followed by a less, a colon or nothing, and record the
  result in a buffer. In classical parsers syntax, this could be
  written like this:</p>

<pre>
  fun buf ->
    parser
    [ [: `'['; `'&lt;' :] ->
        Plexing.Lexbuf.add '&lt;' (Plexing.Lexbuf.add '[' buf)
    | [: `'['; `':' :] ->
        Plexing.Lexbuf.add ':' (Plexing.Lexbuf.add '[' buf)
    | [: `'[' :] ->
        Plexing.Lexbuf '[' buf ]
</pre>

<p>With the new syntax, it is possible to write it as:</p>

<pre>
  lexer [ "[&lt;" | "[:" | "[" ]
</pre>

<p>The two codes are strictly equivalent, but the lexer version is
  easier to write and understand, and is much shorter.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>When loading the syntax extension <tt>pa_lexer.cmo</tt>, the OCaml
  syntax is extended as follows:</p>

<pre>
          expression ::= lexer
               lexer ::= "lexer" "[" rules "]"
               rules ::= ne-rules rule
                       | &lt;nothing&gt;
            ne-rules ::= ne-rules "|" rule
                       | rule
                rule ::= symbols [ "-&gt;" action ]
             symbols ::= symbols symbol err
                       | &lt;nothing&gt;
              symbol ::= "_" no-record-opt
                       | CHAR no-record-opt
                       | CHAR "-" CHAR no-record-opt
                       | STRING no-record-opt
                       | simple-expression
                       | "?=" "[" lookaheads "]"
                       | "[" rules "]"
       no-record-opt ::= "/"
                       | &lt;nothing&gt;
   simple-expression ::= LIDENT
                       | "(" &lt;expression&gt; ")"
          lookaheads ::= lookaheads "|" lookahead-sequence
                       | lookahead-sequence
  lookahead-sequence ::= lookahead-symbols
                       | STRING
   lookahead-symbols ::= lookahead-symbols lookahead-symbol
                       | lookahead-symbol
    lookahead-symbol ::= CHAR
                       | CHAR "-" CHAR
                       | "_"
                 err ::= "?" simple-expression
                       | "!"
                       | &lt;nothing&gt;
              action ::= expression
</pre>

<p>The identifiers "<tt>STRING</tt>", "<tt>CHAR</tt>" and
  "<tt>LIDENT</tt>" above represent the OCaml tokens corresponding to
  string, character and lowercase identifier (identifier starting with
  a lowercase character).</p>

<p>Moreover, together with that syntax extension, another extension is
  added the entry <tt>expression</tt>, typically for the semantics
  actions of the "<tt>lexer</tt>" statement above, but not only. It
  is:</p>

<pre>
  expression ::= "$" "add" STRING
               | "$" "buf"
               | "$" "empty"
               | "$" "pos"
</pre>

<p>Remark: the identifiers "add", "buf", "empty" and "pos" are not
  keywords (they are not reserved words) but just identifiers. On the
  contrary, the identifier "<tt>lexer</tt>", which introduces the
  syntax, is a new keyword and cannot be used as variable identifier
  any more.</p>

<h2>Semantics</h2>

<p>A lexer defined in the syntax above is a shortcut version of a
  parser applied to the specific case of streams of characters. It
  could be written with a normal parser. The proposed syntax is much
  shorter, easier to use and to understand, and silently takes care of
  the lexing buffer for the programmer. The lexing buffers are data
  structures, which are passed as parameters to called lexers and
  returned by them.</p>

<p>Our lexers are of the type:</p>

<pre>
  Plexing.Lexbuf.t -&gt; Stream.t char -&gt; u
</pre>

<p>where "<tt>u</tt>" is a type which depends on what the lexer
  returns. If there is no semantic action (since it it optional), this
  type is automatically "<tt>Plexing.Lexbuf.t</tt>" also.</p>

<p>A lexer is, actually, a function with two implicit parameters: the
  first one is the lexing buffer itself, and the second one the
  stream. When called, it tries to match the stream against its first
  rule. If it fails, it tries its second rule, and so on, up to its
  last rule. If the last rule fails, the lexer fails by raising the
  exception "<tt>Stream.Failure</tt>". All of this is
  the <a href="parsers.html">usual behaviour of stream
  parsers</a>.</p>

<p>In a rule, when a character is matched, it is inserted into the
  lexing buffer, except if the "no record" feature is used (see
  further).</p>

<p>Rules which have no semantic action return the lexing buffer
  itself.</p>

<h3>Symbols</h3>

<p>The different kinds or symbols in a rule are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The token "underscore", which represents any character. Fails
    only if the stream is empty.</li>
  <li>A character which represents a matching of this character.</li>
  <li>A character followed by the minus sign and by another character
    which represent all characters in the range between the two
    characters in question.</li>
  <li>A string with represents a matching of all its characters, one
    after the other.</li>
  <li>An expression corresponding to a call to another lexer, which
    takes the buffer as first parameter and returns another lexing
    buffer with all characters found in the stream added to the
    initial lexing buffer.</li>
  <li>The sequence "<tt>?=</tt>" introducing lookahead
    characters.</li>
  <li>A rule, recursively, between brackets, inlining a lexer.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the cases matching characters (namely underscore, character,
  characters range and string), the symbol can be optionally followed
  by the "no record" character "slash" specifying that the found
  character(s) are not added into the lexing buffer. By default, they
  are. This feature is useful, for example, writing a lexer which
  parses strings, when the initial double quote and final double quote
  should not be part of the string itself.</p>

<p>Moreover, a symbol can be followed by an optional error indicator,
  which can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The character <tt>?</tt> (question mark) followed by a
    string expression, telling that, if there is a syntax error at
    this point (i.e. the symbol is not matched although the beginning
    of the rule was), the exception <tt>Stream.Error</tt> is
    raised with that string as parameter. Without this indicator, it
    is raised with the empty string. This is the same behaviour than
    with classical <a href="parsers.html">stream parsers</a>.</li>
  <li>The character <tt>!</tt> (exclamation mark), which is just an
    indicator to let the syntax expander optimize the code. If the
    programmer is sure that the symbol never fails (i.e. never
    raises <tt>Stream.Failure</tt>), in particular if this symbol
    recognizes the empty rule, he can add this exclamation mark. If it
    is used correctly (the compiler cannot check it), the behaviour is
    identical as without the <tt>!</tt>, except that the code is
    shorter and faster, and can sometimes be tail recursive. If the
    indication is not correct, the behaviour of the lexer is
    undefined.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Specific expressions</h3>

<p>When loading this syntax extension, the
  entry <tt>&lt;expression&gt;</tt>, at level labelled "simple" of the
  OCaml language is extended with the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>$add</tt> followed by a string, specifing that the
    programmer wants to add all characters of the string in the lexing
    buffer. It returns the new lexing buffer. It corresponds to an
    iteration of calls to <tt>Plexing.Lexbuf.add</tt> with all
    characters of the string with the current lexing buffer as initial
    parameter.</li>
  <li><tt>$buf</tt> which returns the lexing buffer converted into
    string.</li>
  <li><tt>$empty</tt> which returns an empty lexing buffer.</li>
  <li><tt>$pos</tt> which returns the current position of the
    stream in number of characters (starting at zero).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lookahead</h3>

<p>Lookahead is useful in some cases, when factorization of rules is
  impossible. To understand how it is useful, a first remark must be
  done, about the usual behaviour of Camlp5 stream parsers.</p>

<p>Stream parsers (including these lexers) use a limited parsing
  algorithm, in a way that when the first symbol of a rule is matched,
  all the following symbols of the same rule must apply, otherwise it
  is a syntax error. There is no backtrack. In most of the cases, left
  factorization of rules resolve conflicting problems. For example, in
  parsers of tokens (which is not our case here, since we parse only
  characters), when one writes a parser to recognize both typical
  grammar rules "if..then..else" and the shorter "if..then..", the
  system transforms them into a single rule starting with "if..then.."
  followed by a call to a parser recognizing
  "else.." <span class="u">or</span> nothing.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, this left factorization is not possible. A
  lookahead of the stream to check the presence of some elements
  (these elements being characters, if we are using this "lexer"
  syntax) might be necessary to decide if is a good idea to start the
  rule. This lookahead feature may unfreeze several characters from
  the input stream but without removing them.</p>

<p>Syntactically, a lookahead starts with <tt>?=</tt> and is
  followed by one or several lookahead sequences separated by the
  vertical bar <tt>|</tt>, the whole list being enclosed by
  braces.</p>

<p>If there are several lookaheads, they must all be of the same size
  (contain the same number of characters).</p>

<p>If the lookahead sequence is just a string, it corresponds to all
  characters of this string in the order (which is different for
  strings outside lookahead sequences, representing a choice of all
  characters).</p>

<p>Examples of lookaheads:</p>

<pre>
  ?= [ _ ''' | '\\' _ ]
  ?= [ "&lt;&lt;" | "&lt;:" ]
</pre>

<p>The first line above matches a stream whose second character is a
  quote or a stream whose first character is a backslash (real example
  in the lexer of OCaml, in the library of Camlp5, named
  "plexer.ml"). The second line matches a stream starting with the two
  characters <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;</tt> or starting with
  the two characters <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>:</tt> (this is
  another example in the same file).</p>

<h3>Semantic actions of rules</h3>

<p>By default, the result of a "lexer" is the current lexing buffer,
  which is of type "<tt>Plexing.Lexbuf.t</tt>". But it is possible to
  return other values, by adding "<tt>-&gt;</tt>" at end of rules
  followed by the expression you want to return, as in usual pattern
  matching in OCaml.</p>

<p>An interesting result, for example, could be the string
  corresponding to the characters of the lexing buffer. This can be
  obtained by returning the value "<tt>$buf</tt>".</p>

<h3>A complete example</h3>

<p>A complete example can be seen in the sources of Camlp5, file
"lib/plexer.ml". This is the lexer of OCaml, either "normal" or
"revised" syntax.</p>

<h3>Compiling</h3>

<p>To compile a file containing lexers, just
  load <tt>pa_lexer.cmo</tt> using one of the following methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Either by adding <tt>pa_lexer.cmo</tt> among the Camlp5
    options. See the Camlp5 manual page or documentation.</li>
  <li>Or by adding <tt>#load "pa_lexer.cmo";</tt> anywhere in the
    file, before the usages of this "lexer" syntax.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to display the generated code</h3>

<p>You can see the generated code, for a file "bar.ml" containing
  lexers, by typing in a command line:</p>

<pre>
  camlp5r pa_lexer.cmo pr_r.cmo bar.ml
</pre>

<p>To see the equivalent code with stream parsers, use:</p>

<pre>
  camlp5r pa_lexer.cmo pr_r.cmo pr_rp.cmo bar.ml
</pre>
