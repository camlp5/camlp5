<h1 class="top">Backtracking parsers</h1>

<p>Backtracking parsers are a second alternative
  of <a href="parsers.html">stream parsers</a>
  and <a href="fparsers.html">functional parsers</a>.</p>

<p>Backtracking parsers are close to functional parsers: they use the
  same stream type, "<tt>Fstream.t</tt>", and their syntax is almost
  identical, its introducing keyword being "<tt>bparser</tt>" instead
  of "<tt>fparser</tt>".</p>

<p>The difference is that they are implemented with <em>full
    backtracking</em> and that they return values of the type
    "<tt>option</tt>" of the triplet: 1/ value, 2/ remaining stream
    and 3/ continuation.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The syntax of backtracking parsers is added together with the
  syntax of functional parsers, when the kit "pa_fstream.cmo" is
  loaded. It is:</p>

<pre>
          expression ::= bparser
                       | match-with-bparser
             bparser ::= "bparser" pos-opt "[" parser-cases "]"
                       | "bparser" pos-opt parser-case
  match-with-bparser ::= "match" expression "with" bparser
        parser-cases ::= parser-cases parser-case
                       | &lt;nothing&gt;
         parser-case ::= "[:" stream-pattern ":]" pos-opt "->" expression
                       | "[:" ":]" pos-opt "->" expression
      stream-pattern ::= stream-patt-comp
                       | stream-patt-comp ";" stream-pattern
    stream-patt-comp ::= "`" pattern
                       | "`" pattern "when" expression
                       | pattern "=" expression
                       | pattern
                       | "when" expression
             pos-opt ::= pattern
                       | &lt;nothing&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Semantics</h2>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>

<p>The backtracking parsers, like classical parsers and functional
  parsers, use a recursive descent algorithm. But:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a stream pattern component does not match the current
    position of the input stream, the control is given to the next
    case of the stream pattern component before it. If it is the first
    stream pattern component, the rule (the stream pattern) is left
    and the next rule is tested.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the following grammar:</p>

<pre>
   E -> X Y
   X -> a b | a
   Y -> b
</pre>

<p>works, with the backtracking algorithm, for the input "<tt>a
  b</tt>".</p>

<p>Parsing with the non-terminal "<tt>E</tt>", the non-terminal
  "<tt>X</tt>" first accepts the input "<tt>a b</tt>" with its first
  rule. Then when "<tt>Y</tt>" is called, the parsing fails since
  nothing remains in the input stream.</p>

<p>In the rule "<tt>X Y</tt>" of the non-terminal "<tt>E</tt>", the
  non-terminal "<tt>Y</tt>" having failed, the control is given the
  the continuation of the non-terminal "<tt>X</tt>". This continuation
  is its second rule containing only "<tt>a</tt>". Then "<tt>Y</tt>"
  is called and accepted.</p>

<p>This case does not work with functional parsers since when the rule
  "<tt>a b</tt>" of the non-terminal "<tt>X</tt>" is accepted, it is
  definitive. If the input starts with "<tt>a b</tt>", there is no way
  to apply its second rule.</p>

<p>Backtracking parsers are strictly more powerful than functional
  parsers.</p>

<h3>Type</h3>

<p>A backtracking parser whose stream elements are of type
  "<tt>t1</tt>", and whose semantic actions are of some type
  "<tt>t2</tt>", is of type:</p>

<pre>
   Fstream.t t1 -> option (t * Fstream.t t1 * Fstream.kont t1 t2)
</pre>

<p>If the backtracking parsers fails, its returning value is
  "<tt>None</tt>".</p>

<p>If it succeeds, its returning value is "<tt>Some (x, strm, k)</tt>"
  where "<tt>x</tt>" is its result, "<tt>strm</tt>" the remaining
  stream, and "<tt>k</tt>" the continuation.</p>

<p>The continuation is internally used in the backtracking algorithm,
  but is can also be used in the main call to compute the next
  solution, using the function "<tt>Fstream.bcontinue</tt>".</p>

<p>It is also possible to directly get the list of all solutions by
  calling the function "<tt>Fstream.bparse_all</tt>".</p>

<h3>Syntax errors</h3>

<p>Like for <a href="fparsers.html">functional parsers</a>, in case of
  syntax error, the error position can be found by using the function
  "<tt>Fstream.count_unfrozen</tt>", the token in error being the
  last unfrozen element of the stream.</p>

<p>A syntax error is not really an error: for the backtracking
  parsers, like for functional parsers, it is viewed as a
  "non-working" case and another solution is searched.<p>

<p>In the backtracking algorithm, depending on the grammar and the
  input, the search of the next solution can be very long. A solution
  is proposed for that in the <a href="grammars.html">extensible
  grammars</a> system when the parsing algorithm is set to
  "backtracking".</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Here is an example which just shows the backtracking algorithm but
  without parsing, an empty stream being given as parameter and never
  referred.<p>

<p>It creates a list of three strings, each of them being choosen
  between <tt>"A"</tt>, <tt>"B"</tt> and <tt>"C"</tt>.</p>

<p>The code is:</p>

<pre>
  #load "pa_fstream.cmo";
  value choice = bparser [ [: :] -> "A" | [: :] -> "B" | [: :] -> "C" ];
  value combine = bparser [: x = choice; y = choice; z = choice :] -> [x; y; z];
</pre>

<p>The function "combine" returns the first solution:</p>

<pre>
  # combine (fstream [: :]);
  - : option (list string * Fstream.t '_a * Fstream.kont '_a (list string)) =
  Some (["A"; "A"; "A"], &lt;abstr>, Fstream.K &lt;fun>)
</pre>

<p>The function "Fstream.bparse_all" returns the list of all solutions,
  showing the interest of the backtracking:</p>

<pre>
  # Fstream.bparse_all combine (fstream [: :]);
  - : list (list string) =
  [["A"; "A"; "A"]; ["A"; "A"; "B"]; ["A"; "A"; "C"]; ["A"; "B"; "A"];
   ["A"; "B"; "B"]; ["A"; "B"; "C"]; ["A"; "C"; "A"]; ["A"; "C"; "B"];
   ["A"; "C"; "C"]; ["B"; "A"; "A"]; ["B"; "A"; "B"]; ["B"; "A"; "C"];
   ["B"; "B"; "A"]; ["B"; "B"; "B"]; ["B"; "B"; "C"]; ["B"; "C"; "A"];
   ["B"; "C"; "B"]; ["B"; "C"; "C"]; ["C"; "A"; "A"]; ["C"; "A"; "B"];
   ["C"; "A"; "C"]; ["C"; "B"; "A"]; ["C"; "B"; "B"]; ["C"; "B"; "C"];
   ["C"; "C"; "A"]; ["C"; "C"; "B"]; ["C"; "C"; "C"]]
</pre>
